# Sanic Bot
Hey everyone so this is a repo for my Discord Bot that has Terminal Support (Like a CLI or something) that its currently using Node JS Readline, in old versions it was using Vorpal and I stopped using it due to a warning message when installing it, anyways you'll see that the code its horrible and I know, I'm doing my best to improve it (kinda), I'll explain stuff below.
# Features and explaining stuff
- Uses JSON files to save data (I just couldn't find any other way to save data and load it and also its somehow dynamic or something)
- Has Terminal Settings (Though they are kinda useless imo, it uses the JSON files to store them)
- Uses Lists, why? Because I can update them while the Terminal its running, its useful for the Settings and ChannelIDS, in old versions there were a Discord Command which allowed to add a Channel ID to the Terminal directly from Discord
- Loads JSON files entries into the Terminal, this uses the Lists mentioned before for real-time changes for Settings and Channel IDS (lmao, real-time changes)
- More stuff that I forgot about and I'm lazy to remember about it
## Feel free to contribute to this uh code and improve it!
